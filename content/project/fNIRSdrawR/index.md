We adapted  eeg coordinates from the "eeg_positions" library (Python) to convert to Cartesian coordinates of the channels of fNIRS, from a given montage of channels and interpolating the regions from a given montage. The code reads a python library, converts it to R language and helps with hyperscanning graphs used in other projects.
