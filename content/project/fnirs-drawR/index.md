Paper in progress: Hyperscanning is a promising tool for investigating the neurobiological underpinning of interaction and affective bonds. 
In this context, networks can identify brain functional mechanisms and regions involved during interactions. In this study, we illustrate the application of graph theory analyzing how channels interact with each other through hyperscanning with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
